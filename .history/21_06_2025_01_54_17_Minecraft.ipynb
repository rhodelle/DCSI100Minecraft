    "Background: Minecraft is an open-world sandbox game created in 2011 by the company Mojang Studio, which allows players to explore and create, either by themselves or with other players. Having a global player base of millions of people over the world, it has become one of the most recognisable and influential video games of all time. A research group led by Frank Wood in UBC's Computer Science program have created a Minecraft server to record data about players' actions and characteristics as they play on the server. The group wants to study player behaviour as running a large server comes with many challenges with resources. They must efficiently allocate limited resources such as server hardware in order to support the amount of players they have playing. Therefore, they must also target recruitment efforts towards valuable users. Here, we classify valuable users as those who play a significant amount and would accordingly contribute a high quantity of data which would benefit their efforts towards obtaining meaningful data and patterns. To support this effort, the group wants to find out through data how different types of players engage within the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "My project will focus on addressing the second of three broad questions by the group:\n",
    "We would like to know which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this topic, I aim to categorize the top 10% of players based on how many hours they have played and build a classification model to predict whether a player belongs to the top 10% based on demographic and experience data. This could help find patterns in characteristics of players who engage the most and allow the group to accordingly aim their outreach effort towards the right direction."

    "To answer our research question of: \"Can we predict whether a player is in the top 10% of total hours played based on their age, gender, and experience level?\" we will be creating visualizations with various characteristics to find patterns, as well as creating a model to predict a top player by using these characteristics. To do this we will be using the k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classification to find if we can detect players considered to be in the top 10% of total hours (`played_hours`) based on their characteristics of `age`, `gender`, and `experience`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. First, we will load the libraries and the data. After loading the data, we must clean and prepare it to ensure all variables can be used correctly. This includes creating a new column named `top_player` which classifies players based on their `played_hours`, where the players within the top 10% of hours are considered a top player (`top`) and the remaining 90% is not (`not_top`).\n",
    "2. Second, we will summarize the data by finding the maximum, minimum, and the mean of the numerical variables in a table. Then, we will use a variety of visualization plots to explore relationships in our variables and use this to guide our modelling.\n",
    "3. Third, we will split the data into training and testing sets. Then we preprocess and create a recipe normalizing the numerical predictors to scale `Age` and `experience_num` and ensure categorical predictors remain as factors for the `kknn` engine.\n",
    "4. Fourth, we will build a k-NN workflow with `neighbors = tune()`. Within the workflow, we will perform an 80/20 stratified split on `top_player`, run 5-fold cross-validation over k = 1:20 to first optimize for accuracy. Then, we select the best 'k' by accuracy, finalize the workflow and fit on the full training set.\n",
    "5. Finally, we predict on the test-set and report the accuracy as well as the confusion matrix.\n",
    "6. (additional) We will tune our model to then focus on `recall` and refit the workflow accordingly to evaluate the new metrics on the test set as well as a confusion matrix to see if the model can be improved."
